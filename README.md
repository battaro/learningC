# Learning C

Hi there! Welcome to my C programming journey in 2024.

## Notes

- To run a C program in Git Bash, first, compile it into an executable file (`.exe`). Once compiled, you can execute it using the following command:
  ```bash
  ./nameofprogram.exe
- C offers a wide variety of data types, which can be overwhelming to remember. For a comprehensive guide, refer to this resource: GeeksforGeeks: Data Types in C [greeksforgeeks datatypes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-c/)
- The `Projects` directory contains all the C programs created during this learning journey.
